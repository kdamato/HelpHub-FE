              <p>This is the service where you can order one of our providers to do things such as landscaping, pet care, help with moving, and house cleaning.</p>
              <p>The process if you want to be a customer is simple. After you have created an account, do a search in your area, select someone and chat about a cost, offer it, and theyâ€™ll be on their way.</p>  
              <p>If you want to be a helper then all you have to do is make an account, go through a background check, and wait for someone to request or chat with you.</p>
